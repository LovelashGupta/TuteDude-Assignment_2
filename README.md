Python Assignment 2
# Simple Python Tasks

This repository contains two beginner-friendly Python scripts demonstrating basic programming concepts: user input, conditional statements, and loops.

## 📁 Files

### `Task 1.py`
This script prompts the user to enter a number and determines whether the number is even or odd.

**How it works:**
- Takes an integer input from the user.
- Uses the modulus operator `%` to check divisibility by 2.
- Prints whether the number is even or odd.

**Sample Output:**
Enter a number: 7
7 is an odd number.


### `Task 2.py`
This script calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 50 using a `for` loop.

**How it works:**
- Initializes a variable `final_sum` to 0.
- Iterates from 1 to 50 using a `for` loop.
- Adds each number to `final_sum`.
- Prints the final result.

**Sample Output:**
The sum of numbers from 1 to 50 is: 1275


## 🛠 Requirements
